The Tasks during my HiWi

The first task:
Help my supervisor complete a specific system based on learning classifier systems (XCS). This system uses The XCS Library (xcslib). You can find more information about the library at http://xcslib.sourceforge.net/

Status：
1. The original system (xcslib) implements the xcs and xcsf systems and can call many functions. But for our system, we don’t need so many functions, so I should specialize this library. (The specificization of this library is complete.)

2. Then I will complete the final required system according to specific requirements. the code will be uploded to the OCtask directory. 

3. Finally, according to the required input form, I will simulate simple input and perform simple test on the system, and the test results should also be uploaded.

ToDo:
Complete the final required system according to specific requirements.
